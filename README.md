# EfficientAT_tensorflow
 Refer to this github repository address: [https://github.com/fschmid56/EfficientAT](https://github.com/fschmid56/EfficientAT). The main code idea was applied to this specific project ----- audio classification.

Training with tensorflow preprocessing and pytorch models; In subsequent inference, tensorflow preprocessing +onnx inference is used to achieve the goal of inference on the tensorflow architecture（without any pytorch code）.
